# spatha.js 🗡

🚧 Status: In Development 🛠️
***
Spatha is a tiny micro utility library for fast building web interfaces to speed up the first feedbacks from clients avoiding the initially dilemma of *"which technology should I use/or be mandatory?" 🤔🤓😶

🔧 This tool was (inspired) meant to be a JSX-like for UI web platform **prototyping**, no stacks needs to learn, just use the loyal and eternal Web Standards: vanilla JavaScript, Web APIs, HTML5, CSS3 and the awesome Web Components v1.

Using as starting point the [HTML templating implementation](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_template-literals.html#sec_html-tag-function-implementation) provided by Dr. Axel Rauschmayer at his book.
