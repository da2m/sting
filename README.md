# spatha.js 🗡

🚧 Status: In Development 🛠️
***
SpathaJS is a simple and tiny utility library for building fast web interfaces, aimed to speed up the firsts feedbacks from clients, delaying the initially dilemma of *"which technology should I use/or will be mandatory?" 🤔🤓😶

🔧 This micro tool was (inspired) meant to be a JSX-like for UI web platform **prototyping**, avoiding the first battleground with evil stacks and bad configurations that you must learn. Just use what is familiar, the loyal and trusted _cohortes praetorianae_ of Web Development, the eternal Web Standards: vanilla JavaScript, Web APIs, HTML5, CSS3 and the awesome Web Components v1 together.

Using as starting point the [HTML templating implementation](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_template-literals.html#sec_html-tag-function-implementation) provided by Dr. Axel Rauschmayer at his book.
